Given your hardware constraints (8 GB RAM, 2 GB VRAM, Core i5 processor), running large LLMs will be challenging, but you can work with smaller or quantized models. Here's a step-by-step workflow to split an LLM across three laptops and run inference collaboratively.

---

### **Step-by-Step Workflow for Splitting an LLM Across Laptops**

#### **Step 1: Choose a Suitable Model**
For your hardware, I recommend these models that can be split and run across devices:

1. **Mistral 7B (quantized 4-bit)** – Good performance with reduced memory footprint (~5-7 GB).
2. **LLaMA 2 (7B, quantized 4-bit)** – Open-source and well-optimized for splitting.
3. **GPT-J 6B (quantized)** – Manageable size with good performance on low-end GPUs.
4. **Phi-2 (2.7B)** – Lightweight and ideal for lower hardware capabilities.
5. **GPT-2 (1.5B)** – A smaller but still capable model for experimentation.

---

#### **Step 2: Install Required Software**
On all three laptops, install:

- **Python (>=3.9)**  
- **PyTorch (for CPU/GPU depending on capability)**  
- **Transformers Library (Hugging Face)**  
- **BitsAndBytes (for quantization)**  
- **MPI (Message Passing Interface, for distributed computing)**  
- **Ray or Deepspeed (for distributed model inference)**  

```bash
pip install torch transformers accelerate bitsandbytes mpi4py ray deepspeed
```

---

#### **Step 3: Quantize and Split the Model**
Since your hardware is limited, quantization is crucial to reduce memory load. Use Hugging Face's `bitsandbytes` to load a quantized model.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1"

# Load quantized model (4-bit for low memory)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", load_in_4bit=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Save model in chunks for splitting
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model_split.pth")
```

You can manually split the model checkpoint into 3 parts (manually or using Python's `shutil` module).

---

#### **Step 4: Distribute Model Parts Across Laptops**
Split model weights across 3 machines, for example:

1. **Laptop 1:** Embedding + Attention layers (first part)
2. **Laptop 2:** Middle layers
3. **Laptop 3:** Final layers + Output

Copy the respective model chunks to each laptop using:

```bash
scp model_part1.pth user@laptop1:/path/to/store
scp model_part2.pth user@laptop2:/path/to/store
scp model_part3.pth user@laptop3:/path/to/store
```

---

#### **Step 5: Run Distributed Inference**
Use **Ray** or **MPI** to distribute inference across the laptops. Example with MPI:

On Laptop 1, run the master script:

```bash
mpirun -np 3 --host laptop1,laptop2,laptop3 python distributed_inference.py
```

Sample code for distributed inference (`distributed_inference.py`):

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

if rank == 0:
    # Laptop 1 - Load and process first part
    model_part1 = torch.load("model_part1.pth")
    comm.send(model_part1, dest=1)
elif rank == 1:
    # Laptop 2 - Receive, process, and forward
    model_part1 = comm.recv(source=0)
    model_part2 = torch.load("model_part2.pth")
    comm.send(model_part2, dest=2)
elif rank == 2:
    # Laptop 3 - Final processing
    model_part2 = comm.recv(source=1)
    model_part3 = torch.load("model_part3.pth")
    print("Inference completed")
```

---

#### **Step 6: Synchronization and Communication**
Use efficient networking via **Ethernet** or a local wireless network to ensure smooth data transfer between machines.

---

#### **Step 7: Optimize Performance**
- Use **quantization (4-bit/8-bit)** to reduce memory load.
- Load parts of the model to the GPU when available.
- Use lightweight frameworks like **GGUF format** for efficient loading on CPU.

---

### **Challenges and Considerations**
1. **Latency:** Communication overhead can slow down inference.
2. **Memory Limitations:** Keep model parts small enough to fit within the available RAM/VRAM.
3. **Parallelism:** Ensure correct ordering of layers to maintain inference consistency.
4. **Hardware Compatibility:** Ensure all laptops have compatible Python environments.

### **Step 1: Load the GPT-2 Model**
First, install the required dependencies if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

Now, load the model:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load GPT-2 model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Save the entire model for reference (optional)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "gpt2_full.pth")
```

---

### **Step 2: Split the Model into Two Parts**
GPT-2 consists of transformer blocks (e.g., 12 for GPT-2 small). We can split them into two halves.

```python
# Get all transformer blocks
transformer_blocks = model.transformer.h

# Split model into two halves
midpoint = len(transformer_blocks) // 2
part1_blocks = transformer_blocks[:midpoint]
part2_blocks = transformer_blocks[midpoint:]

# Create two separate model parts
model_part1 = torch.nn.Sequential(*part1_blocks)
model_part2 = torch.nn.Sequential(*part2_blocks)

# Save the two parts separately
torch.save(model_part1.state_dict(), "gpt2_part1.pth")
torch.save(model_part2.state_dict(), "gpt2_part2.pth")

print("Model successfully split into two parts.")
```

---

### **Step 3: Transfer the Model Parts to Different Laptops**
After splitting, transfer each part to the respective machine using SCP:

```bash
scp "E:\GitHub_Desktop\Geo-Distributed-Large-Language-Model\gpt2_part1_taher.pth" user@laptop1:/path/to/store/
scp "E:\GitHub_Desktop\Geo-Distributed-Large-Language-Model\gpt2_part2_rabiul.pth" "Robiul Hasan@192.168.0.103:'D:\University of Oulu\Last Education\1st Year\3rd Period\DS'"
```

Replace `user`, `laptop1/laptop2`, and `/path/to/store/` with your actual details.

---

### **Step 4: Load and Run Inference Separately**
On each laptop, load and process its part of the model.

**Laptop 1 (part 1):**
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

model_part1 = torch.load("gpt2_part1.pth")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

input_text = "Once upon a time"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

# Process through first half
output_part1 = model_part1(input_ids)
torch.save(output_part1, "output_part1.pth")
```

**Laptop 2 (part 2):**
```python
import torch

model_part2 = torch.load("gpt2_part2.pth")
output_part1 = torch.load("output_part1.pth")

# Process through second half
final_output = model_part2(output_part1)
print("Final output:", final_output)
```
