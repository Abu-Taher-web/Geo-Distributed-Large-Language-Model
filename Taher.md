Given your hardware constraints (8 GB RAM, 2 GB VRAM, Core i5 processor), running large LLMs will be challenging, but you can work with smaller or quantized models. Here's a step-by-step workflow to split an LLM across three laptops and run inference collaboratively.

### **Step-by-Step Workflow for Splitting an LLM Across Laptops**

#### **Step 1: Choose a Suitable Model**
For your hardware, I recommend these models that can be split and run across devices:

1. **Mistral 7B (quantized 4-bit)** – Good performance with reduced memory footprint (~5-7 GB).
2. **LLaMA 2 (7B, quantized 4-bit)** – Open-source and well-optimized for splitting.
3. **GPT-J 6B (quantized)** – Manageable size with good performance on low-end GPUs.
4. **Phi-2 (2.7B)** – Lightweight and ideal for lower hardware capabilities.
5. **GPT-2 (1.5B)** – A smaller but still capable model for experimentation.

#### **Step 2: Install Required Software**
On all three laptops, install:

- **Python (>=3.9)**  
- **PyTorch (for CPU/GPU depending on capability)**  
- **Transformers Library (Hugging Face)**  
- **BitsAndBytes (for quantization)**  
- **MPI (Message Passing Interface, for distributed computing)**  
- **Ray or Deepspeed (for distributed model inference)**  

```bash
pip install torch transformers accelerate bitsandbytes mpi4py ray deepspeed
```

---

#### **Step 3: Quantize and Split the Model**
Since your hardware is limited, quantization is crucial to reduce memory load. Use Hugging Face's `bitsandbytes` to load a quantized model.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1"

# Load quantized model (4-bit for low memory)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", load_in_4bit=True)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Save model in chunks for splitting
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model_split.pth")
```

You can manually split the model checkpoint into 3 parts (manually or using Python's `shutil` module).

#### **Step 4: Distribute Model Parts Across Laptops**
Split model weights across 3 machines, for example:

1. **Laptop 1:** Embedding + Attention layers (first part)
2. **Laptop 2:** Middle layers
3. **Laptop 3:** Final layers + Output

Copy the respective model chunks to each laptop using:

```bash
scp model_part1.pth user@laptop1:/path/to/store
scp model_part2.pth user@laptop2:/path/to/store
scp model_part3.pth user@laptop3:/path/to/store
```

---

#### **Step 5: Run Distributed Inference**
Use **Ray** or **MPI** to distribute inference across the laptops. Example with MPI:

On Laptop 1, run the master script:

```bash
mpirun -np 3 --host laptop1,laptop2,laptop3 python distributed_inference.py
```

Sample code for distributed inference (`distributed_inference.py`):

```python
from mpi4py import MPI
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
rank = comm.Get_rank()
size = comm.Get_size()

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1")

if rank == 0:
    # Laptop 1 - Load and process first part
    model_part1 = torch.load("model_part1.pth")
    comm.send(model_part1, dest=1)
elif rank == 1:
    # Laptop 2 - Receive, process, and forward
    model_part1 = comm.recv(source=0)
    model_part2 = torch.load("model_part2.pth")
    comm.send(model_part2, dest=2)
elif rank == 2:
    # Laptop 3 - Final processing
    model_part2 = comm.recv(source=1)
    model_part3 = torch.load("model_part3.pth")
    print("Inference completed")
```

#### **Step 6: Synchronization and Communication**
Use efficient networking via **Ethernet** or a local wireless network to ensure smooth data transfer between machines.

---

#### **Step 7: Optimize Performance**
- Use **quantization (4-bit/8-bit)** to reduce memory load.
- Load parts of the model to the GPU when available.
- Use lightweight frameworks like **GGUF format** for efficient loading on CPU.

### **Challenges and Considerations**
1. **Latency:** Communication overhead can slow down inference.
2. **Memory Limitations:** Keep model parts small enough to fit within the available RAM/VRAM.
3. **Parallelism:** Ensure correct ordering of layers to maintain inference consistency.
4. **Hardware Compatibility:** Ensure all laptops have compatible Python environments.
